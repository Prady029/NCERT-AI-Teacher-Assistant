# NCERT-AI-Teacher-Assistant
The AI assistant for teachers that creates lesson plans, drafts question sets, and many more...
The project has been started as a passion project to marry my background of teaching in school in previos years to my current profession of data science.

## Objectives
---
TLDR: help teacher in reducing their wokrload by automating paperworks
The main idea here is to help teacher do theor actual job rather than getting strunged by paper weights.
A lot of documentation gets created as matter of fact that has been reduced to mere sham.
1. Lesson Plan
2. Unit tests
3. Exam paper drafting

## Plan of Approach
---
We have large language models that can help a teacher get things done, however, most of the time, teachers do not have the technical knowledge to self host llms on their devices let alone use them in the educational context. Hence, I came up with this project to help teacher teach rather than get stuck with drafting papers.

## Requirements
---
Internet access and a mobile device.
