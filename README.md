# NCERT-AI-Teacher-Assistant

The AI assistant for teachers that creates lesson plans, drafts question sets, and many more. This project was started as a passion project to combine my background in teaching with my current profession in data science.

## Objectives

---

**TLDR:** Help teachers reduce their workload by automating paperwork.

The main idea is to help teachers focus on their actual job rather than being burdened by paperwork. A lot of documentation gets created as a matter of fact, but it has been reduced to a mere formality.

1.  Lesson Plan creation
2.  Unit test generation
3.  Exam paper drafting

## Plan of Approach

---

Large language models (LLMs) can help teachers accomplish various tasks. However, most teachers lack the technical knowledge to self-host LLMs on their devices or use them effectively in an educational context. Therefore, I created this project to help teachers teach, rather than get bogged down with drafting papers.

## Requirements

---

Internet access and a mobile device.
